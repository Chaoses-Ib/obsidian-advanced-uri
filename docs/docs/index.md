# Obsidian Advanced URI

## Motivation

I created this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin initially to load workspaces per URI.
I even created a [feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/load-workspace-per-url-scheme/7120) on the forum to add that feature to Obsidian's own URI schema, but I ended up solving it myself with this plugin. 

Since then, many new features were added (most of them from feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri)).
As today, I don't even use this plugin anymore, but I'm very happy that **many** others do, partly on a daily basis.
